Project Overview:
This project focuses on applying ML techniques to analyse employee data and predict the likelihood of attrition. The aim was to help the organization identify factors responsible for attrition, Develop & Predict employees at risk and suggest targeted retention strategies, reducing turnover, improving workforce stability.
Key Tasks Performed:
Collected and processed primary data from 549 employees via structured questionnaires and secondary data from company reports.
Conducted data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using encoding and visualization techniques.
Built and compared multiple ML models including:
Logistic Regression → Accuracy: 77%
Feedforward Neural Network → Accuracy: 77%
Random Forest → Accuracy: 97% (Best Model)
Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing department-wise attrition, satisfaction levels, and key attrition reasons.
Validated model performance and tested hypotheses to ensure prediction reliability.
Tools & Skills Used:
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression, Feedforward Neural Network, Random Forest
Data Visualization: Tableau
Techniques: One-Hot Encoding, Multivariate Analysis, EDA
Skills: HR Analytics, Predictive Modeling, Data Cleaning, Statistical Analysis, Business Insights
Key Outcomes:
Achieved 97% prediction accuracy using the Random Forest model.
Identified 122 attrition cases (22.22% attrition rate).
Found key attrition drivers: family problems (39 cases), ineffective grievance system (35), and biased performance appraisal (30).
Highlighted departments with highest attrition Operations & Maintenance, Engineering, and Finance.
Provided actionable HR recommendations for retention and engagement.
Conclusion:
The study successfully established a data driven HR analytics framework for predicting employee attrition. By leveraging machine learning insights can proactively address key attrition causes, reduce employee turnover, and foster a more engaged and productive workforce.
